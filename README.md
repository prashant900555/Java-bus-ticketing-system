#NOTE - Download the "Install Bus Ticketing System.exe" file & Install the software program in any drive except C. [Note: Please don't install the software in C drive or your respective Program files drive.]  

The client uses JAVA JDK environment to run the JAR file, and maintains their records, however it is not possible them to share the data from multiple system in multi user environment, since there is lot of duplicate work, and chance of mistake. When the records of any bus are changed the admin needs to update them periodically without fail. There is an option available to find and print previous saved records. There is full security; admin can access only his report and sensitive data, also user can access only his login form. This Bus Ticketing System is used to overcome the entire problem which they are facing currently, and making complete atomization of manual system to computerized system.

    Let the splash screen load, select user or admin according to your need.
	Default username for admin is ‘admin’ and password for admin is also ‘admin’.

	For user’s to log in, they have to enter their own personal username and password, if they don’t have one, they have to create their new user id by clicking new user registration button.

	In the admin’s control panel, we can add bus details, delete bus details, edit bus details and have a summary of entered bus details.

	Also admin can have a look at user’s ticket booked and user’s logged in information. Admin has the option to delete the "Booking Details" and the "Customer Details", if there is an erronous entry or invalid entry into the database & only if the ticket has expired.In usual applications too, admin has the full control over the deletion of the user accounts, so we have included it too.

	In the user’s control panel, user has to select the available buses given by the admin and book the tickets by entering no. of tickets to be booked (no. of tickets should be less than the total no. of seats).

	Also user can have a look at the booked tickets and can print it or cancel it according to his need. (only his valid booked ticket and no others).

	The printed ticket is saved in the Bus Management Project file and can be viewed as a PDF.

	There is also a logout button and a close project button available on the top right corner of our project form.

	In this way, our project is executed and same steps were used to test our project.

Even if you see this project as a single installation executable file, there were efforts made to make this delightful GUI work.

If you liked the GUI and the working of the software application please feel free to contact me on the details given below for any further assistance in making Java Desktop Applications.
